Got it working (was simpler than I thought), then resolved using a cool functional library called Ramda.

There's no regex magic, just some currying and careful placement of arguments to always put data last.

### Instructions

Install `nodemon` and `ramda`:

```
npm i
```

Run program:

`npm start`
