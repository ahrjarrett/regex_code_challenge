Got it working (was simpler than I thought), then refactored using a cool functional library called Ramda that I've been learning.

There's no regex magic, just some currying and clever placement of arguments so data is always last, which allows us to compose functions into data pipelines.

### Instructions

Install `nodemon` and `ramda`:

```
npm i
```

Run program:

`npm start`
